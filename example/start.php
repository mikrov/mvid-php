     * you should specify a context that determines what dev or test instance to run on.
     * The environment and context is read from the mvid-config.php file, but can also be specified here as:
     * $mvidEnv = "dev";
     * $mvidContext = "mvid-v31";
     * These needs to be set before including the mvid-handler.php
     * After including mvid-handler.php you also have the variable $mvid_url that defines the url of the mvid instance you are using
