           1. "cookie"   - If you plan to develope an application that communicates with MV-ID's webservices via javascript
                           you must store the mv_session_id as a session cookie on the client's browser.

           2. "php"      - On the other hand, if yuo are going to do all communications to MV-ID's webservices from the
                           serverside, you might as well store the mv_session_ids as a PHP session variable.

           3. "memcache" - If you have more than one backend webserver and want to do communication with MV-ID's webservices
                           on the serverside you might concider using a memcache server for storing mv_session_ids. That
                           way you can share it between you backend webservers effortlessly.

           4.            - If you want to store your mv_session_id a completely different way you can extend the with a new
                           session storage class by adding it in the directory sessionstorage.
